## Introducing Myself

Hi! I am currently an undergraduate senior studying at Bryn Mawr College. I am a psychology major and a student researcher in the [DEER Lab](https://www.brynmawrdeerlab.org/). Through my coursework and student research, I have gained experience and enhanced my skills in data cleaning and analysis in R. I am also familiar with structural equation modeling and working on models with AMOS.
